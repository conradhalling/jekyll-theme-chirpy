I have been taking photos for the past few years solely with the camera of my
iPhone (iPhone 5S, iPhone SE 1st generation, and most recently iPhone SE 2nd
generation). These cameras have been functional but not great.

I have been considering buying the iPhone 13 Pro, which has three lenses,
including a telephoto and a wide angle lens, where one of the lenses allows
taking very close photos without a macro lens. It is my hope that, using this
phone, I can expand the types of photos I can take.

However, Apple has been adding more algorithms for improving the quality of
photos, and some people think Apple has gone too far. In this article in the *New
Yorker*, [“Have iPhone Cameras Become Too Smart?”](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/have-iphone-cameras-become-too-smart), Kyle Chayka argues that Apple’s
processing algorithms are ruining photos.

So I will think about it.
