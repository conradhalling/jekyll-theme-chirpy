I have an idea for a science fiction story in which the world building involves
two Earth-like planets that revolve around each other (technically, around their
barycenter, which would be located roughly between the two planets). When I took
physics in 1972-1973, I knew enough math to be able to calculate a circular
orbit of a satellite around the Earth.
