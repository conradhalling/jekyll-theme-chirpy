I am listening to the audiobook [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze
Age Riders from the European Steppes Shaped the Modern
World](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148182/the-horse-the-wheel-and-language)
by David W. Anthony. I have read a few similar books describing how linguists
have partially reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language.

Looking through our library at home, I found a copy of *In Search of the
Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology, and Myth* by J. P. Mallory (1989, Thames
and Hudson), which I should read again.

But what if I wanted more than introduction to this subject? It seems that I
would need to read technical books on linguistics and philology. Linguistics is
a very broad field. Where to start? For my future reference, I have listed
results from an internet search.

[Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/) offers [Essentials
of Linguistics, 2nd Edition](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/599)
by Catherine Anderson, Bronwyn Bjorkman, and Derek Denis.

[Cambridge Textbooks in
Linguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/series/cambridge-textbooks-in-linguistics/79990002F07F78DC02C536C2BD183E71)
comprises 77 books. [Language
Change](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/language-change/819E0034CEAAC4B156117E45F49AD12C#overview)
by Joan Bybee and [Evolutionary
Linguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/evolutionary-linguistics/8461343EBFA33D3384B60D693E02A0CD)
by April McMahon and Robert McMahon might be two good books to start with.

This book might be too introductory: [The First Word: The Search for the Origins
of
Language](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/291215/the-first-word-by-christine-kenneally/)
by Christine Kenneally (published in 2008).

[The Handbook of
Linguistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119072256),
edited by Mark Aronoff and Janie Rees-Miller looks like a useful collection of
chapters on various topics in linguistics including linguistic anthropology and
ethnolinguistics. I might start with this book for a more detailed introduction
to the various subfields of linguistics.

[The Handbook of English
Linguistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119540618),
edited by Bas Aarts, April McMahon, and Lars Hinrichs, appears to contain
technical introductions to various aspects of the English language.

[An Introduction to Language and
Linguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/languages-linguistics/english-language-and-linguistics-general-interest/introduction-language-and-linguistics-2nd-edition?format=PB&isbn=9781107637993)
by Ralph W. Fasold and Jeff Connor-Linton has a chapter on computational
linguistics.
