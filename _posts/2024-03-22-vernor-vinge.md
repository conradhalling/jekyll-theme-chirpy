Today I learned from [File 770](https://file770.com/vernor-vinge-1944-2024/)
(via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)) that Vernor Vinge, professor
and science fiction author, died on March 20, 2024. I have read several of his
novels, which I highly recommend; the most brilliant are [A Fire Upon the
Deep](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250237750/afireuponthedeep) and [A
Deepness in the Sky](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429915090/adeepnessinthesky).
