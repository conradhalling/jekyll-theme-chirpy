On March 27, 2024, the *New York Times* published an obituary for [Henrietta
Leavitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/obituaries/henrietta-leavitt-overlooked.html),
the discoverer of the [period-luminosity
relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation) for Cepheid
variable stars. Using this relation, astronomers were able to discover that the
universe was much bigger than originally thought. This obituary is part of the
[Overlooked](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/overlooked) effort of the New
York Times to publish obituaries of notable persons who were overlooked by the
newspaper at the times of their deaths. All modern astronomy textbooks contain a
section about this important discovery.
