I am taking a class called Cosmology 101 (I will describe this in a separate
post). The instructor posted the link to one of the videos in Sean Carroll’s
“The Biggest Ideas in the Universe” series on YouTube. The series is described
in this
[post](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2020/03/19/the-biggest-ideas-in-the-universe-introduction/)
on Sean Carroll’s [blog](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/).

The first video in this 48-video series is located
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI09kat_GeI&list=PLrxfgDEc2NxZJcWcrxH3jyjUUrJlnoyzX).
