Today I finished the audiobook of [*A Series of Fortunate Events: Chance and the
Making of this Planet, Life, and
You*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691201757/a-series-of-fortunate-events)
by Sean B. Carroll. ([Sean B. Carroll](https://www.seanbcarroll.com/about/), a
biologist, and [Sean M. Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/about/), a
cosmologist, are two different people.) This very good book is about the role of
chance in biology and life and how unlikely it is that you and I exist.

[The Inquisitive Biologist](https://inquisitivebiologist.com/) ([Leon
Vlieger](https://inquisitivebiologist.com/about/)) has written an excellent
[review](https://inquisitivebiologist.com/2022/03/18/book-review-a-series-of-fortunate-events-chance-and-the-making-of-the-planet-life-and-you/)
of this book.
