To stay up with the latest developments in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (a
popular programming language), I listen to the [Python Bytes
podcast](https://pythonbytes.fm/). Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken do the work
of capturing the latest important news about Python and summarize it in about 30
minutes each week. The show notes contain links to each topic they discuss. This
is the best developer-oriented podcast that I have found.
