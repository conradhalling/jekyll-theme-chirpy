A tourist in modern Middle-earth could take a walking tour of Hobbiton led by
guides dressed as hobbits, featuring a historically authentic recreation
of Bag-End and souvenir shops selling mathoms and leather-bound replicas of the
Red Book of Westmarch. 

Go horseback riding in Rohan. Take a river cruise down the Anduin. Try
spelunking in Moria wearing rechargeable headlamps. Hop in your EV and drive the
autobahn from Annûminas to Minas Tirith, stopping at Bree for a hamburger and
soft drink. Visit the ruins of Barad-dúr and buy a replica of the One Ring.

Or ride a high-speed train from the Lonely Mountain to the White Towers.
