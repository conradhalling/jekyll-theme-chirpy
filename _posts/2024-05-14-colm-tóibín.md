title: Colm Tóibín
description: One of my frustrations as a reader is learning about an excellent book or writer that I know I won’t find the time to read (because my want to read list is already so long).

Today I listened the New York Times Book Review Podcast of May 3, 2024, in which
[Sarah Lyall interviews Colm
Tóibín](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/books/review/a-conversation-with-colm-toibin.html).

Tóibín, who is an Irish writer aged 68, has just published [Long
Island](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Long-Island/Colm-Toibin/9781476785110),
the sequel to his novel
[Brooklyn](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Brooklyn/Colm-Toibin/Eilis-Lacey-Series/9781501106477),
which was published in 2009. Tóibín, in addition to writing novels, teaches at
Columbia University and writes nonfiction, essays, and reviews. In the
interview, Tóibín is articulate, intelligent, and likeable, and in another life
I would take classes taught by him.
