Tonight I begin taking a four-week course titled [Introduction to
Astrochemistry](https://aaa.org/event/introduction-to-astrochemistry-2024/2024-05-21/)
from the [Amateur Astronomers Association, Inc.](https://aaa.org/), taught by
[Samantha Scibelli, Ph.D.](https://samscibelli.github.io/) Dr. Scibelli gave a
free two-hour presentation about EM (electromagnetic) waves for the AAA on
Wednesday May 15. Links to the recordings of the free lectures are available
from the [aaa.org](https://aaa.org) website, but at the time of writing, a link to this lecture is
not yet available.

To prepare for this course, I looked for textbooks on astrochemistry. Among the
resources recommended by Dr. Scibelli is [The
Astrochymyst](https://www.astrochymist.org/) website, which has a charmingly
ancient 1990s design. The Astrochymyst site is produced by [David E. Woon,
Ph.D.](http://www.astrochymist.org/woon/), who has collected information for
many years on resources in astrochemistry. Among these resources, Dr. Woon
provides a page that lists [astrochemistry texts and
books](https://www.astrochymist.org/astrochymist_texts.html).

I explored the list of books and decided to purchase
[*Astrochemistry*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/book/10.1021/acsinfocus.7e5004) by
Olivia Harper Wilkins and Geoffrey A. Blake. This is a digital book from the In
Focus series produced by the American Chemical Society, available only through
the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/). The digital books in this
series include links, videos, animations, and molecular models. The series is
intended for readers of all educational levels to quickly (within four to eight
hours) gain an understanding of a topic in chemistry.
