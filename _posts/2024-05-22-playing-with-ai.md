I recently took an astronomy course in which the instructor demonstrated how to
use ChatGPT to answer questions about a scientific topic such as the Big Bang.
This prompted me to sign up for a ChatGPT Plus account ($20 per month) at
[OpenAI](https://openai.com). Using my subscription, I have been experimenting
with ChatGPT by asking specific and speculative questions, such as “How many
astronomical units are there in a light-year?” and “How do we send exploratory
spacecraft to Proxima Centauri?”. This is a fun tool that can be used by people
who write speculative fiction.

I played briefly with creating images using OpenAI’s DALL-E; see [Modern
Technology in
Middle-earth](https://conradhalling.com/blog/posts/modern-technology-in-middle-earth/),
in which I asked DALL-E to create an image of a high-speed train traveling
through a Middle-earth landscape.

Shortly after I obtained my subscription, OpenAI added ChatGPT-4o to its models,
where “o” stands for “omni”. ~~They have promised a macOS app, which is being
rolled out slowly, not to me yet, and other new features that appear to be
vaporware so far. In fact, as I write this I’m unable to access DALL-E (“GPT not
found”).~~

[**Update on May 24, 2024**: Today I was able to download the ChatGPT
app to my MacBook Pro, where it behaves identically to the web interface,
including providing access to DALL-E. A Windows app is promised in the future,
but the Mac app was released first because more ChatGPT users use Macs.]

In the meantime, Microsoft announced its new line of Copilot+ PCs, where Copilot
is Microsoft’s AI assistant. The new computers, on the way from several
manufacturers besides Microsoft, use the Snapdragon X Plus or Elite ARM
processors. Microsoft claims they are faster than the MacBook Air, which uses
Apples M series of ARM-based CPUs. All of these ARM processors run much faster
than Intel’s and AMD’s x86_x64 processors.

I currently own a 13.5-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 with an Intel i5
processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD; this cost only $1200. I bought this laptop
to use when I need a PC and for portability. It is adequate for my needs,
although it performs poorly with software that requires a good GPU for graphics
support. When I buy a PC, I prefer Microsoft’s computers because they don’t come
loaded with bloatware (defined as software installed by the manufacturer that
you don’t want or need).

The presale price for the new 13.8-inch Surface Laptop with the Snapdragon X
Elite processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD is $1,400, which I consider pretty
reasonable considering the new 13-inch M3 MacBook Air with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB
SSD costs $1500. I’m going to wait for the reviews before buying.

Finally, next month (June 2024), Apple will hold its developer conference,
WWDC24, when Apple is expected to announce new AI initiatives. Apple just
released new models of the iPad Air (M2 processor) and iPad Pro (M4 processor),
which are widely acknowledged by reviewers to be beautiful pieces of engineering
that are inadequately supported by the iOS operating system. Everyone is hoping
that the new version of iOS will take advantage of the raw processing speed of
the M2 and M4 processors and provide AI assistance that is better than Siri.
