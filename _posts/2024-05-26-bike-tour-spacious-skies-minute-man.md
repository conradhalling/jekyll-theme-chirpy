I started touring for 2024 on May 19-20, 2024, with a two-day one-night short
tour from my home in Somerville, Massachusetts to the [Spacious Skies Minute Man
Campground](https://spaciousskiescampgrounds.com/minute-man/) near Littleton,
Massachusetts.

I left at 2:15 pm on Sunday, May 19, 2024. I rode out the Somerville Community
Path, Linear Trail, and Minuteman Bikeway to Bedford. Since it had rained the
day before, I decided not to ride the unpaved bike bath to Concord, which I was
afraid would be slick and muddy. I took Route 62 through Concord and West
Concord; this is a pretty busy road, but it has adequate shoulders, and drivers
are used to bicyclists on that road. I rode the Bruce Freeman Trail and Concord
Rd to Acton, where I used Appleâ€™s iOS Maps app for route planning. But I missed
a turn and ended up on Routes 27 and 110 between Acton and West Acton; both of
these roads have heavy traffic, narrow shoulders, and potholes. I found a series
of back roads that took me smoothly to the campground.

[Spacious Skies Minute Man](https://spaciousskiescampgrounds.com/minute-man/) is
a private RV park with some pretty good sites for tent camping. The park was
about a third full when I arrived on Sunday evening at 6:00 pm. I had a site as
nice as any I have occupied in Massachusetts state parks.

The campground has about 100 sites with a central restroom with showers and a
dishwashing station. Nearby are the office, a laundry room, a swimming pool, and
a clubhouse. The campground is located near a railroad and a road with a lot of
early morning truck traffic. I was awakened a few times during the night
(Sunday/Monday) by train horns or noisy trucks, but earplugs (which I carry)
would have solved this problem.

I woke to birdsong at 5:30 am Monday morning. Nearby campers were still
sleeping. I explored the park thoroughly, after which I ate breakfast, packed
up, and departed at 9:15 am.

I made an unfortunately wrong turn early, wasting about five miles of effort.
And like the trip out, I missed a turn and ended up on Routes 111 and 27 between
West Acton and Acton once again. I managed to reroute myself onto some decent
back roads until I reached the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail. I rode to West Concord
and took Route 62 to the head of the Minute Man Bikeway, where I paused thirty
minutes for lunch. I cruised down the bike trails into Somerville and home,
arriving at 1:30 pm.

I was very, very tired after this two-day trip, for which my total mileage was
71.0 miles in 24 hours. I had been training by riding my Trek Valencia 25 miles
three times a week, with my longest ride reaching 35 miles, but I have a ways to
go to get into shape for longer touring. But the weather was good with not a
drop of rain or dew. This was a very good first tour for 2024.
