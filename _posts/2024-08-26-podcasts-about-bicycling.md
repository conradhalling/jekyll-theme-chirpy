[Cycling Over Sixty](https://www.cyclingoversixty.com/)

When Tom Butler was about to turn sixty in 2023, he decided he needed to get
into shape to ride the [Seattle to
Portland](https://cascade.org/rides-events/seattle-portland-2024) (STP) ride
organized by the [Cascade Bicycle Club](https://cascade.org). I think Tom's
podcast is the best podcast about bicycling for us older cyclists. Tom
chronicles his personal journey in successfully riding STP in 2023 and 2024. The
strengths of this podcast are Tom's candor and his interviews of experts in
health, fitness, and bicycling. If you have the time, I recommend you start with
the very first episode.
