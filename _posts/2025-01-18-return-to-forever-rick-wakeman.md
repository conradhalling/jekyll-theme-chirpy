This afternoon I listened to [*Romantic
Warrior*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_Warrior) by [Return to
Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Forever). I remember buying
this album when it was released in 1976 and listening to it repeatedly for the
rest of the year. At the time, I was living in Southeast Portland, Oregon, with
my best friend. Listening to the album brought back many memories, mostly good
but some sad. The album is intricate with astounding musicianship, and
it has always been a favorite of mine.

After listening to *Romantic Warrior* in 1976, I bought later albums by [Chick
Corea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea) (keyboards), [Stanley
Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Clarke) (bass), and [Al Di
Meola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Di_Meola) (guitar), three of the four
members of this incarnation of Return to Forever along with [Lenny
White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_White) (drums).

An aside: [Al Di Meola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Di_Meola), [Pat
Metheny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny) (another great guitarist),
and I were all born in the summer of 1954. But I am a poor player of guitar.

The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_Warrior) about
the *Romantic Warrior* album claimed that the album was [Chick
Corea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea)'s response to [Rick
Wakeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Wakeman)'s album [The Myths and
Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round
Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myths_and_Legends_of_King_Arthur_and_the_Knights_of_the_Round_Table).

Since I didn't remember ever listening to Wakeman's album, which was hugely
successful, I listened to it tonight. It's a good album, but I think its
style and content are very different from the Return to Forever album.
Wakeman's album has many alternative rhythms and key changes, but it is not
as sophisticated as the Return to Forever album. I am going to listen to
this album again.
