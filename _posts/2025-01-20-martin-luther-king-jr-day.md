description: Be kind to your neighbors.

After we had snow a couple of weeks ago, some of our neighbors never cleaned
their sidewalks. This made it difficult to walk the dogs, who like to pull on
their leashes, making walking dangerous on icy sidewalks.

We had about four inches of snowfall last night. After clearing our sidewalk, 
I cleared the sidewalks for the immediate neighbors (we often shovel one another's
walks, which is helpful when someone is traveling and not home to shovel). Then
I walked up to the corner and cleared the sidewalks for the neighbors who,
for whatever reason, never shovel. I also cleared the crosswalk
where the snowplows had left ridges of ice and snow, making it difficult to
cross. 

I believe we need to defy the MAGAs and their cruel and corrupt policies. One place to
start is to perform kindnesses for others.
