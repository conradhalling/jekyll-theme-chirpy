description: I have run steadily for 13 weeks without injury and have increased my long run to 10 miles.

These are the miles I've logged since I started running again on November 2, 2024.
I am trying to not train too hard and to increase my miles slowly but
steadily. I have succeeded in running 39 times in the past 13 weeks without
injury.

I ran the 4-mile Gobble, Gobble, Gobble race on Thursday, November 28
(Thanksgiving Day), at a sub-10:00 pace. My training runs are usually at a 10:35
or slower mile pace. 

I deliberately ran very little the week of January 13 since I needed a rest
week. Unfortunately, I ran very little following week of January 20 because of
snow, ice, and cold weather. I am back on track this week.

I have steadily increased my long run each week to 10 miles. I plan to continue
increasing my long run one mile each week in February to 14 miles on the last
weekend of the month.
