I am a Ph.D. molecular biologist who worked in industry in various roles
including bioinformatics scientist, data manager, data analyst, full stack web
developer, and team lead. I continued writing code until I retired at the end of
February 2022. My career was challenging and rewarding, and I miss working
collaboratively to solve hard research problems.

My pursuits are now astronomy, reading, listening to audiobooks and music,
programming computers, running, and bicycle touring. I write about books, music,
running, and bicycling here. I write about science and computers on my other
blog at [sphaerula.com](https://sphaerula.com).
