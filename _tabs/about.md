## About Conrad Halling

### Education

I earned B.A. degrees in chemistry (1979) and biology (1982) at Portland State
University and a Ph.D. in molecular biology (1989) at the University of
California, Berkeley. I was an American Cancer Society post-doctoral fellow at
the University of Chicago (May 1989 - August 1993).

### Employment History

I worked in the biotechnology industry for 28+ years (November 1993 through
February 2022). I filled various roles, including bioinformatics scientist,
project manager, data manager, data analyst, web developer, database
administrator, Linux administrator, grant writer, hiring manager, consultant,
and team lead. During my career, I worked primarily as a member of teams that
wrote tools for designing DNA constructs and for managing laboratory data. We
supported laboratory scientists in designing cloning experiments; managing DNA
and protein samples; and collecting, presenting, and interpreting protein assay
data.

My career was challenging and rewarding, and I miss working collaboratively to
solve hard research problems.

### Technical Skills

Given my domain expertise in molecular biology—having worked at the laboratory
bench for ten years during my graduate school and post-doctoral research—I could
apply my experience and knowledge towards writing computerized tools for
molecular biologists. I used many programming languages over the years,
including (in approximate chronological order) C, Fortran, Oracle SQL, Perl,
HTML, CSS, R, C++, PHP, bash, MySQL, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I
also used tools such as SVN, Git, JIRA, and Slack. I was still writing code
using Python, JavaScript, and SQL when I retired at age 67 years 6 months at
the end of February 2022.

### Current Activities

I am fortunate to live in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area with my
wife Joan Caywood and our two dogs, Celyn and Holly. Now that I'm retired, my
activities include astronomy, computers, computer programming, dabbling in data
science and machine learning, and reading about science. I write about these
activities here.

My other activities include reading science fiction and other fiction and
nonfiction, listening to audiobooks and music, running, and bicycle touring. Oh,
and dog walking—so much dog walking. I write abut these activities on my other
blog at [conradhalling.com](https://conradhalling.com/blog/).

I hang out on Reddit, and I'm experimenting with Bluesky. I no longer use
Twitter/X, Facebook, or Instagram, and I don't have other social media accounts.
