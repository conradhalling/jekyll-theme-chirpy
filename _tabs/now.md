## Monday January 27, 2025

I am still listening to two audiobooks: *Sodom and Gomorrah* (translated to English)
by Marcel Proust and *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers.

I spent the last ten days learning how to use the [Jekyll Chirpy
theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) for creating this blog.
This is an excellent theme for blogging about technical subjects, but I found
the [theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) to be a little difficult to read and
lacking in color. I dug into the theme's style and developed three variants of
the theme that increase contrast and readability and add consistent colors to
the pages. This blog uses my green variant of the Chirpy theme; I developed
two other variants using green and slate gray as the base colors. I am
working on a detailed description.

I have been listening to science and technology podcasts while walking the
dogs. I will be posting soon lists of the podcasts I regularly consume. 

Because of a planned week off followed by snow and ice, I haven't run much in the
past two weeks. I plan to get back to regular runs because I'm thinking of
running the Hyannis Half Marathon the first weekend of March.
